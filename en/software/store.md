#Store

This section will describe the `app store` for robots (drones) that [Erle Robotics](http://erlerobotics.com) is pushing [through its partnership with Canonical](http://ubuntu.com/things) to support the next generation of drones that will be **connected to the internet**, **update automatically** and **will have access to an app store for drones**. Following up with our passion for bringing Linux-based drones to the market we are happy to share that the first apps are starting to show up in the store and are freely available:
